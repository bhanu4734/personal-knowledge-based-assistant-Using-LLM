# MindWeaver: AI-Powered Personal Knowledge Management System

MindWeaver is an AI-powered personal knowledge management system that acts as your 'second brain.' It allows users to upload TXT and PDF files, uses FAISS for vector search, and runs a local LLM for answering queries. The project is designed for students, researchers, and knowledge workers, focusing on privacy and local processing.
